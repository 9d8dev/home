## 9d8.dev Home

This is the repo for the 9d8.dev website. 

Built on Next.js, it is currently a simple lander that we hope to grow into a hub for all things 9d8 and dev related.

9d8 is a development studio owned and operated by [Bridger Tower](https://github.com/brijr) and [Cameron Youngblood](https://github.com/youngbloodcyb).
